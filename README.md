# 🪙 Gold Price Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting gold prices using historical data and machine learning models. It is built with Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Overview

The notebook uses historical financial data to forecast gold price trends. Data preprocessing, visualization, and model training are all done within a single notebook: `project.ipynb`.

## 🛠️ Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of price trends
- Machine learning model(s) for prediction
- Evaluation of model accuracy
- Interactive graphs (via Plotly or similar, exported as HTML)
